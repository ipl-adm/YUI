# YUI (pre-alpha)
## A UI system for GMS2 by [@shdwcat](https://github.com/shdwcat)

**NOTE:** YUI is ***not*** ready for use in production code yet!

### Why YUI?
Writing UI code is annoying and tedious! Why write UI code when you can edit some powerful little yaml files instead?

Notable features:
- Live Reload while the game is running!
- Simple but flexible data-binding system to get your game data into the UI
- Powerful Drag and Drop feature built in (no coding!)
- Customizable theme
- Template system lets you design and re-use custom widgets

### OK, where do I start?
Documentation is in progress! Feel free to browse the code while you wait :)

### The Example Project
Contained in this repo is the YUI Example project. If you clone the repo locally you can run the project to get an idea of what YUI is capable of. The Example Project is still a work in progress, but make sure to check out the Inventory Screen for an example of how to quickly set up drag and drop!

NOTE: At the moment, the Example Project might not run correctly out of the box, I'm working on fixing that!

### Dependencies
YUI has a number of dependencies, which are automatically included in the project.
