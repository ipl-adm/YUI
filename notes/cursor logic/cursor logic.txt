trackMouseOver in Begin Step sets up the mouse element stack:
panel -> button -> text
(actually use a list so different events can walk it)

each element needs to handle a mouse event e.g. 
1. text Left Released will check isMouseOver
2. if false, it checks the next element and calls event_perform on that (which recurses)

it's possible trackMouseOver should also register which events an element is looking for?
and then YuiCursorManager could handle all the events in PreDraw

alternately maybe yui_base implements the events?

maybe each render item has an events:YuiEvents object with fields for the various events
then when button handles the click, it can walk the mouseover stack to check
if anything above it will actually handle that click

is checking that list faster than yui_base implementing each event?
